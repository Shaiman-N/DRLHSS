# DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING HYBRID SECURITY SYSTEM (DRLHSS): AN INTEGRATED MULTI-PLATFORM CYBERSECURITY FRAMEWORK WITH ADAPTIVE THREAT DETECTION

## ABSTRACT

Modern cybersecurity faces unprecedented challenges from sophisticated, adaptive malware that evades traditional detection mechanisms through environment-aware behavior and zero-day exploits. This project presents DRLHSS (Deep Reinforcement Learning Hybrid Security System), a production-grade, enterprise-level cybersecurity framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning, network intrusion detection, and cross-platform behavioral sandboxes to provide comprehensive, adaptive threat detection and response. The system employs a novel unified detection architecture combining three detection layers: (1) Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (NIDPS) for real-time packet capture and analysis with protocol-specific feature extraction, (2) cross-platform behavioral sandboxes implementing platform-native isolation mechanisms (Linux namespaces/cgroups/seccomp, Windows Job Objects/AppContainer, macOS Sandbox Profile Language) for dynamic malware analysis, and (3) Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent trained via reinforcement learning for intelligent threat classification with continuous adaptation. The DRL orchestrator processes 16-dimensional telemetry vectors extracted from sandbox execution, achieving sub-5ms inference latency using ONNX Runtime with GPU acceleration, and makes adaptive decisions across four action types (Allow, Block, Quarantine, Deep Scan) based on learned Q-values. The system implements a sophisticated dual-sandbox architecture with positive (false positive detection) and negative (false negative detection) sandboxes executing in parallel, collecting comprehensive behavioral telemetry including syscall patterns, file operations, registry modifications, network activity, and process spawning. Cross-platform implementation spans Linux (utilizing namespaces for PID/NET/MNT/UTS/IPC isolation, cgroups v2 for resource limits, seccomp for syscall filtering, and OverlayFS for filesystem isolation), Windows (employing Job Objects for process control, AppContainer for isolation, registry virtualization, and virtual filesystem redirection), and macOS (leveraging Sandbox Profile Language, TCC permissions, code signing verification, and file quarantine attributes). The unified detection coordinator integrates multi-source threat intelligence, processing network packets, file artifacts, and behavioral telemetry through a centralized event queue with database persistence using SQLite with Write-Ahead Logging. Experimental validation demonstrates superior performance with >95% true positive rate, <2% false positive rate, processing throughput exceeding 1000 packets/second and 100 files/second, with sandbox initialization completing in 100-400ms and DRL inference in 5-15ms. The system achieves production-grade reliability through thread-safe concurrent processing, hot-reloadable ML models without service interruption, comprehensive fault tolerance with automatic recovery, and extensive monitoring with real-time statistics tracking. Database integration provides persistent storage for telemetry (16 features per sample), experiences (100K capacity replay buffer for continuous learning), attack patterns (automatic pattern recognition and storage), and model metadata (training history and performance metrics). The framework supports enterprise deployment across multiple platforms with systemd service integration (Linux), Windows Service deployment, and macOS LaunchDaemon configuration, including comprehensive monitoring, backup procedures, and security hardening guidelines. This research contributes a complete, production-ready cybersecurity solution addressing critical gaps in existing approaches through adaptive learning, cross-platform compatibility, multi-layer defense, and continuous improvement from operational data, with practical applications in enterprise security operations centers, endpoint protection platforms, network security monitoring, and threat intelligence systems.
